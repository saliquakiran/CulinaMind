      "user_message": "What can I substitute for eggs?",
      "ai_response": "Given your interest in muscle building and weight gain, eggs are a great source of protein and nutrients that can be beneficial. However, if you're looking for egg alternatives, especially for recipes like pancakes or baked goods, there are several options to consider. Here are some egg substitutes you can use:\n\n1. **Flaxseed or Chia Seed \"Eggs\":**\n   - **Ratio:** 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseeds or chia seeds + 3 tablespoons of water = 1 \"egg.\"\n   - **How to Use:** Mix the ground seeds with water and let it sit for a few minutes until it becomes gel-like. Add it to your recipe as you would an egg.\n\n2. **Banana:**\n   - **Ratio:** 1 ripe mashed banana = 1 egg.\n   - **How to Use:** Use mashed ripe banana to add moisture and binding properties to your recipes. Keep in mind that this will add a slight banana flavor.\n\n3. **Yogurt or Silken Tofu:**\n   - **Ratio:** 1/4 cup of plain yogurt or silken tofu = 1 egg.\n   - **How to Use:** These options add moisture and help bind ingredients together, especially in baking.\n\n4. **Commercial Egg Replacer:**\n   - **Ratio:** Follow package instructions for the equivalent of 1 egg.\n   - **How to Use:** These products are specifically designed to replace eggs in recipes without altering the flavor or texture significantly.\n\n5. **Carbonated Water or Baking Soda and Vinegar:**\n   - **Ratio:** 1/4 cup carbonated water or 1 teaspoon baking soda + 1 tablespoon vinegar = 1 egg.\n   - **How to Use:** These options can help provide leavening in recipes like pancakes and cakes.\n\nWhen using these substitutes, keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary slightly from the original recipe. It's always a good idea to experiment a bit to find the combination that works best for your preferences.\n\nIf you have a specific recipe in mind that you'd like to modify without eggs, feel free to share it, and I can provide more tailored suggestions for that particular dish.",
