      "ai_response": "Storing fresh herbs properly can help preserve their flavor and texture for a longer period. Here's how you can store fresh herbs, considering your dietary restrictions and preferences:\n\n1. **Washing and Drying:** Start by washing the herbs gently under cold water to remove dirt and any impurities. Pat them dry with paper towels or use a salad spinner to remove excess moisture. It's essential to make sure they are completely dry before storing them.\n\n2. **Trimming and Bundling:** Trim the ends of the herb stems to promote water uptake. Next, loosely bundle the herbs together. For herbs like parsley, cilantro, or dill, you can place them in a jar with water, just like fresh flowers. Cover them loosely with a plastic bag and secure it with a rubber band.\n\n3. **Refrigeration:** Store the herbs in the refrigerator. If you have a dedicated drawer for vegetables and herbs, place the herbs there. If not, you can use the vegetable crisper drawer. Make sure the herbs are not crowded, as good air circulation helps maintain freshness.\n\n4. **Alternative Method - Freezing:** If you want to store herbs for a more extended period, consider freezing them. Chop the herbs finely and place them in an ice cube tray. Fill each compartment with water or olive oil and freeze. Once frozen, transfer the herb cubes to a freezer-safe bag. This method works well for herbs like basil, mint, or chives.\n\n5. **Labeling:** To avoid confusion, consider labeling the storage containers or freezer bags with the herb type and the date of storage.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that your fresh herbs stay flavorful and ready to enhance your German and Vietnamese dishes while adhering to your low-sodium and halal dietary restrictions.",
