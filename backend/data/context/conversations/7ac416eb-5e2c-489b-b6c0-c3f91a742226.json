      "ai_response": "Storing fresh herbs properly is essential to maintain their flavor and freshness. Here's how you can store fresh herbs based on your preferences and equipment available:\n\n1. **For Short-Term Storage**:\n   - **Method**: Place the herbs in a glass of water (like you would with fresh flowers) and cover loosely with a plastic bag. Alternatively, you can wrap the herbs in a damp paper towel and store them in a plastic bag.\n   - **Location**: Keep them in the refrigerator.\n   - **Duration**: This method works well for a few days.\n\n2. **For Long-Term Storage**:\n   - **Method**: Freezing is a great way to preserve herbs for longer periods.\n   - **Air Fryer Adaptation**: If you have an air fryer, you can dry the herbs before freezing by placing them in a single layer in the air fryer basket at a low temperature for a short time. This can help preserve the herbs' flavors better.\n   - **Pressure Cooker Adaptation**: Alternatively, you can make herb-infused oils or butter in the pressure cooker and store them in airtight containers in the refrigerator or freezer.\n   - **Duration**: Frozen herbs can last for several months.\n\n3. **General Tips**:\n   - **Washing**: Only wash herbs right before using them to prevent moisture build-up that can lead to spoilage.\n   - **Trimming**: Trim the ends of the herb stems before storing to maintain freshness.\n   - **Labeling**: If storing herbs in the freezer, label the containers with the herb type and date for easy identification.\n\nBy following these methods, you can ensure that your fresh herbs stay flavorful and ready to use for your German and Vietnamese dishes while adhering to your low-sodium and halal dietary restrictions.",
