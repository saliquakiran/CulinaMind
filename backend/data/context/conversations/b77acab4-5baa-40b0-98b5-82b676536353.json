      "ai_response": "To make fluffy pancakes, you can follow this step-by-step guide:\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n- 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 1 tablespoon white sugar\n- 1 1/4 cups buttermilk\n- 1 egg\n- 3 tablespoons melted butter\n\nInstructions:\n1. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.\n2. In a separate bowl, whisk the buttermilk, egg, and melted butter until well combined.\n3. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the wet ingredients. Stir until just combined; do not overmix. Lumps are okay.\n4. In another clean bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.\n5. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the pancake batter. This will help make the pancakes fluffy.\n6. Let the batter rest for about 10 minutes to allow the baking powder to activate and the gluten to relax.\n7. Heat a non-stick frying pan or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or cooking spray.\n8. Pour 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the pan.\n9. Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.\n10. Repeat with the remaining batter.\n\nServe your fluffy pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh berries, or a dollop of whipped cream. Enjoy your delicious homemade pancakes!",
