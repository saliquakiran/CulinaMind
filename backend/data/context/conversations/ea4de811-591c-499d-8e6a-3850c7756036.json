      "ai_response": "Storing fresh herbs properly can help extend their shelf life and maintain their flavors. Here's how you can store different types of herbs to keep them fresh:\n\n1. **Refrigerator Method**:\n   - **Soft Herbs (Parsley, Cilantro, Mint)**: Trim the ends of the stems, place them in a jar or glass with water (like a bouquet), cover loosely with a plastic bag, and store in the refrigerator. Change the water every few days.\n   - **Woody Herbs (Rosemary, Thyme, Sage)**: Wrap them in a slightly damp paper towel and place them in a resealable plastic bag. Store in the refrigerator.\n\n2. **Freezing Method**:\n   - **Soft Herbs**: Chop the herbs finely and place them in ice cube trays. Fill the trays with water or olive oil and freeze. Once frozen, transfer the herb cubes to a freezer-safe bag.\n   - **Woody Herbs**: Woody herbs like rosemary and thyme can be frozen on their stems. Place them in a resealable bag and freeze. You can also freeze them chopped or in oil.\n\n3. **Drying Method**:\n   - Hang the herbs upside down in a warm, dry place with good airflow. Once dry, store them in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.\n\n4. **Herb Keeper**:\n   - Consider investing in an herb keeper, a specialized container that helps prolong the life of fresh herbs by providing the right amount of water and ventilation.\n\n5. **Labeling**:\n   - Make sure to label your stored herbs with the date to keep track of their freshness.\n\nBy following these methods, you can enjoy fresh herbs for a longer period, enhancing the flavor of your dishes.",
