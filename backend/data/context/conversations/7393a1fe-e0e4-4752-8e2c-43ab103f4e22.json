      "ai_response": "For a beginner-level option with a low-sodium focus and considering your dietary preferences and health goals, here are some substitutes for eggs in your recipes:\n\n1. **Flaxseed or Chia Seed \"Eggs\"**\n   - **Ratio:** 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed or chia seeds mixed with 3 tablespoons of water.\n   - **How to Use:** Let the mixture sit for a few minutes until it thickens to an egg-like consistency.\n   - **Best For:** Baking recipes like pancakes, muffins, or cookies.\n\n2. **Banana**\n   - **Ratio:** 1/4 cup mashed ripe banana per egg.\n   - **How to Use:** Mash the banana until smooth before incorporating it into the recipe.\n   - **Best For:** Sweet baked goods like cakes and quick breads.\n\n3. **Silken Tofu**\n   - **Ratio:** 1/4 cup blended silken tofu per egg.\n   - **How to Use:** Blend until smooth for a creamy texture.\n   - **Best For:** Recipes where a denser texture is desired, like brownies or custards.\n\nUsing these alternatives will help you maintain the structure and texture of your dishes while keeping them low-sodium and suitable for your preferences. Remember to adjust the seasoning to suit your taste when using these substitutes. Enjoy your cooking!",
